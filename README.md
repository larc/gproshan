## Contributions

### CHE implementation
We have implemented a [Compact Half-Edge (CHE)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.523.7580) data structure to manipulated triangular meshes, also can be extended for other polygonal meshes.
See the paper: [CHE: A scalable topological data structure for triangular meshes](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.523.7580) for more details.

### Geodesics
We proposed a CPU/GPU parallel algorithm to compute geodesics distances on triangular meshes. Our
approach is competitive with the current methods and is simple to implement. Please cite our paper:

[A minimalistic approach for fast computation of geodesic distances on triangular meshes](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cag.2019.08.014)

}
```

Also, we have implemented the [Fast Marching algorithm](), and the [Heat method](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/HeatMethod/index.html).

### Dictionary Learning
We proposed a Dictionary Learning and Sparse Coding framework, to solve the problems of Denoising,
Inpainting, and Multiresolution on triangular meshes. This work is still in process. Please cite

### Hole repairing
We implemented repairing mesh holes in two steps:

1. Generate a mesh to cover the hole. We modified the algorithm presented in the paper: [A robust hole-filling algorithm for triangular mesh](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00371-007-0167-y), in order to
generate a planar triangular mesh using a priority queue.
2. Fit the surface described by the new points in order to minimize the variation of the surface,
solving the Poisson equation (see the Chapter 4 of the book [Polygon Mesh Processing](http://www.pmp-book.org/)) or using Biharmonic splines.

### Key-Points and Key-Components

We proposed a simple method based on the faces' areas to compute key-points for adaptive meshes.

Please cite our paper (in Spanish):

[Efficient approach for interest points detection in non-rigid shapes](https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEI.2015.7359459)

```bibtex
@INPROCEEDINGS{7359459,
	author		= { C. J. Lopez Del Alamo and L. A. Romero Calla and L. J. Fuentes Perez },
	booktitle	= { 2015 Latin American Computing Conference (CLEI) },
	title		= { Efficient approach for interest points detection in non-rigid shapes },
	year		= { 2015 },
	month		= { Oct },
	pages		= { 1-8 },
	doi		= { 10.1109/CLEI.2015.7359459 }
}
```

Computing key-components depends on the accuracy and definition of the key points. We were inspired
by the [work of Ivan Sipiran](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262350194_Key-component_detection_on_3D_meshes_using_local_features),
he defined for the first time the notion of a key-component in meshes.
We proposed a method based on geodesics to determine the key components.

Please see and cite our final undergraduate project: [key-components report](http://repositorio.unsa.edu.pe/handle/UNSA/2575) (in Spanish).


### Decimation
We are implementing the algorithm described by the paper [Stellar Mesh Simplification Using Probabilistic Optimization](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8659.2004.00811.x),
to compute a mesh simplification.

### Fairing
We implemented Spectral and Taubin fairing algorithms to smooth a mesh surface.
See the Chapter 4 of the book [Polygon Mesh Processing](http://www.pmp-book.org/).

### Laplacian and signatures
Laplace-Beltrami operator and its eigen decomposition, WKS, HKS, GPS signatures.

## Viewer
The viewer was initially based in the viewer of [https://github.com/dgpdec/course](https://github.com/dgpdec/course). The current viewer uses VAO and VBO to render, and the shaders have been modified and upgraded.
